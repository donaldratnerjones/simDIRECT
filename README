This repository contains code and documentation for the simDIRECT global 
optimization algorithm:

IMPORTANT NOTE:

To compute the dominated hypervolume, simDIRECT expects the user
to have downloaded the open-source code of Fonseca et al that
computes this quantity.  Instructions for getting this code and
compiling it into a Matlab MEX file are given below.  If you 
don't do this, simDIRECT will still run and compute the Pareto set, 
but it will just report the dominated hypervolume as zero -- which 
means you won't be able to track progress converging to the Pareto front
while the optimization is running.

How to get the Hypervolume code for Matlab:

* Go to:  http://lopez-ibanez.eu/hypervolume#download  

* Download the Version 1.3 source code and unzip the tar file.  
  You should get a directory called hv-1.3-src.
  Open MATLAB and go to the hv-1.3-src directory.  

* At the MATLAB command prompt, run:  
  mex -DVARIANT=4 Hypervolume_MEX.c hv.c avl.c

* This should give you a file called
  Hypervolume_MEX.mexw64 (Windows) or
  Hypervolume_MEX.mexmaci64 (Mac)

* Put this file on the path when using simDIRECT
